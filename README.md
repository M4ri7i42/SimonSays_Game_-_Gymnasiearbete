This is a README file. In here, a short introduction of a Simon Says' contents will be presented.

## What is this project? 
This project has been to make a digital Simon Says game using HTML, CSS & Javascript.

## What is the purpose of this project?
To see if a game can give players the feeling that they have the potential of improving their focus and memory if they keep playing the game.

## Why Simon Say?
Simon Says was given as an example from the project's supervisor, Mr Sabino. Because no other idea was given as much interest, a Simon Says game it became. 


## How to play:
1. Press the On/Off button to boot up the machine.
2. Press the Start button to start the game.
3. When the game starts, a sequence of four blinking buttons will appear on screen. The player's goal is to mimc the pattern shown on screen and progress further into the game.
4. With each beaten round, the sequence is increased by one blink.
